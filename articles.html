          <p>"Buzzers are big in New York City. Favored particularly by
            smaller stores and boutiques, merchants throughout the city have
            installed them as screening devices to reduce the incidence of robbery.
            When the buzzer sounds, if the face at the door looks "desirable," the
            door is unlocked. If the face is that of an "undesirable," the door
            stays locked. Predictably, the issue of undesirability has revealed
            itself to be primarily a racial determination.​"</p>
