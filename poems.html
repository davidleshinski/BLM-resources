      <h2>When I Think of Tamir Rice While Driving</h2>
      <p class="poem-author">Reginald Dwayne Betts</p>
      <p>
in the backseat, my sons laugh & tussle,<br>
far from Tamir’s age, adorned with his<br>
complexion & cadence, & already warned
<br><br>
about toy pistols, though my rhetoric<br>
ain’t about fear, but dislike—about<br>
how guns have haunted me since I first gripped
<br><br>
a pistol; I think of Tamir, twice-blink<br>
& confront my weeping’s inadequacy, how<br>
some loss invents the geometry that baffles.
<br><br>
The Second Amendment—cold, cruel,<br>
a constitutional violence, a ruthless<br>
thing worrying me still, should be it predicts
<br><br>
the heft in my hand, arm sag, burdened by<br>
what I bear: My bare arms collaged<br>
with wings as if hope alone can bring
<br><br>
back a buried child. A child, a toy gun,<br>
a blue shield’s rapid rapid rabid shit. This<br>
is how misery sounds: my boys
<br><br>
playing in the backseat juxtaposed against<br>
a twelve-year-old’s murder playing<br>
in my head. My tongue cleaves to the roof
<br><br>
of my mouth, my right hand has forgotten.<br>
This is the brick & mortar of the America<br>
that murdered Tamir & may stalk the laughter
<br><br>
in my backseat. I am a father driving<br>
his Black sons to school & the death<br>
of a Black boy rides shotgun & this
<br><br>
could be a funeral procession, the death<br>
a silent thing in the air, unmentioned—<br>
because mentioning death invites taboo:
<br><br>
if you touch my sons the blood washed<br>
away from the concrete must, at some<br>
point, belong to you, & not just to you, to
<br><br>
the artifice of justice that is draped like a blue<br>
g-d around your shoulders, the badge that<br>
justifies the echo of the fired pistol; taboo:
<br><br>
the thing that says freedom is a murderer’s body<br>
mangled & disrupted by my constitutional<br>
rights come to burden, because the killer’s mind
<br><br>
refused the narrative of a brown child, his dignity,<br>
his right to breathe, his actual fucking existence,<br>
with all the crystalline brilliance I saw when
<br><br>
my boys first reached for me. This world best<br>
invite more than story of the children bleeding<br>
on crisp falls days, Tamir’s death must be more
<br><br>
than warning about recklessness & abandoned<br>
justice & white terror’s ghost—& this is<br>
why I hate it all, the protests & their counters,
<br><br>
the Civil Rights attorneys that stalk the bodies<br>
of the murdered, this dance of ours that reduces<br>
humanity to the dichotomy of the veil. We are
<br><br>
not permitted to articulate the reasons we might<br>
yearn to see a man die. A mind may abandon<br>
sanity. What if all I had stomach for was blood?
<br><br>
But history is no sieve & sanity is no elixir<br>
& I am bound to be haunted by the strength<br>
that lets Tamir’s father, mother, kinfolk resist
<br><br>
the temptation to turn everything they see<br>
into a grave & make home the series of cells<br>
that so many brothers already call their tomb.</p>

<h2>A Small Needful Fact</h2>
<p class="poem-author">Ross Gay</p>
      <p>Is that Eric Garner worked
        <br>
for some time for the Parks and Rec.
<br>
Horticultural Department, which means,
<br>
perhaps, that with his very large hands,
<br>
perhaps, in all likelihood,
<br>
he put gently into the earth
<br>
some plants which, most likely,
<br>
some of them, in all likelihood,
<br>
continue to grow, continue
<br>
to do what such plants do, like house
<br>
and feed small and necessary creatures,
<br>
like being pleasant to touch and smell,
<br>
like converting sunlight
<br>
into food, like making it easier
<br>
for us to breathe.</p>

      <h2>not an elegy for Mike Brown</h2>
      <p class="poem-author">Danez Smith</p>
      <p>I am sick of writing this poem<br>
but bring the boy. his new name
<br><br>
his same old body. ordinary, black<br>
dead thing. bring him & we will mourn<br>
until we forget what we are mourning
<br><br>
& isn’t that what being black is about?<br>
not the joy of it, but the feeling
<br><br>
you get when you are looking<br>
at your child, turn your head,<br>
then, poof, no more child.
<br><br>
that feeling. that’s black.
<br><br>
\\
<br><br>
think: once, a white girl
<br><br>
was kidnapped & that’s the Trojan war.
<br><br>
later, up the block, Troy got shot<br>
& that was Tuesday. are we not worthy
<br><br>
of a city of ash? of 1000 ships<br>
launched because we are missed?
<br><br>
always, something deserves to be burned.<br>
it’s never the right thing now a days.
<br><br>
I demand a war to bring the dead boy back<br>
no matter what his name is this time.
<br><br>
I at least demand a song. a song will do just fine.
<br><br>
\\
<br><br>
look at what the lord has made.<br>
above Missouri, sweet smoke.</p>

      <h2>American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin [Even the most kindhearted white woman]</h2>
      <p class="poem-author">Terrance Hayes</p>
    <p>Even the most kindhearted white woman,<br>
Dragging herself through traffic with her nails<br>
On the wheel & her head in a chamber of black<br>
Modern American music may begin, almost<br>
Carelessly, to breathe <em>n</em>-words. Yes, even the most<br>
Bespectacled hallucination cruising the lanes<br>
Of America may find her tongue curls inward,<br>
Entangling her windpipe, her vents, toes & pedals<br>
When she drives alone. Even the most made up<br>
Layers of persona in a two- or four-door vehicle<br>
Sealed in a fountain of bass & black boys<br>
Chanting n-words may begin to chant inwardly<br>
Softly before she can catch herself. Of course,<br>
After that, what is inward, is absorbed.

<h2>Facing US</h2>
<p class="poem-author">Amanda Johnston</p>
<br>
  <p><em>after Yusef Komunyakaa</em>
<br><br><br><br>
My black face fades,<br>
hiding inside black smoke.<br>
I knew they'd use it,<br>
dammit: tear gas.<br>
I'm grown. I'm fresh.<br>
Their clouded assumption eyes me<br>
like a runaway, guilty as night,<br>
chasing morning. I run<br>
this way—the street lets me go.<br>
I turn that way—I'm inside<br>
the back of a police van<br>
again, depending on my attitude<br>
to be the difference.<br>
I run down the signs<br>
half-expecting to find<br>
my name protesting in ink.<br>
I touch the name Freddie Gray;<br>
I see the beat cop's worn eyes.<br>
Names stretch across the people’s banner<br>
but when they walk away<br>
the names fall from our lips.<br>
Paparazzi flash. Call it riot.<br>
The ground. A body on the ground.<br>
A white cop’s image hovers<br>
over us, then his blank gaze<br>
looks through mine. I’m a broken window.<br>
He’s raised his right arm<br>
a gun in his hand. In the black smoke<br>
a drone tracking targets:<br>
No, a crow gasping for air.</p>

<h2>No, Kanye, it’s not LIKE we’re mentally in prison</h2>
<p class="poem-author">Erica Dawson</p>
    <p>
    <em>for my grandfather</em>

We don’t have heirlooms. Haven’t owned things long<br> <span class="tab">enough.</span> We’re hoarding us<br>
in our stories.                        <span class="tab"> Like October 26—the</span><br> <span class="tab">Oklahoma Quick</span><br>
Stop gas at 90¢ and, in 158 more days,
<br><br>
Passion of the Christ in a wildlife<br>
refuge with Rabbits foot and Black<br>
Capped birds—when Edgar Whetstone shoots
<br><br>
himself. Like August 4, 1919. Like Ada Willis births<br>
the boy conceived with Boy gone somewhere. Like her<br> <span class="tab">prayers and circa 10</span><br>
years past and Mr. Charlie saying, Edgar reads <em>(you<br> call that<br>
<span class="tab">clean?)</span>
<br><br>
but please, girl, coloreds don’t become<br>
doctors.</em> Like Edgar trashed his books.<br>
Like served, discharged. Like funeral
<br><br>
director close to doctor as it got.  <span class="tab">Formaldehyde</span><br>
      <span class="tab">wrecked him</span><br>
like <em>Time to get up out the South</em> Detroit inspect dynamics<br> <span class="tab">burn</span><br>
a house down torch the county jail.      <span class="tab">Like now,</span><br>
<span class="tab">October. Like I found,</span>
<br><br>
searching the internet, one shot<br>
of the asylum’s blurry hall<br>
empty but for an organ’s pipes.
<br><br>
I saw Edgar deluding hymns rousing the two of us in <em>Rock<br>
of Ages</em> followed by Philippians 1:21—<em>to die<br>
is gain.</em> No way to prove the claim, you die in dream,<br> you die for<br>
<span class="tab">real.</span>
<br><br>
Our family still hanged from trees.<br>
Like if they ever fall, no one<br>
will hear it someday for a while.</p>
